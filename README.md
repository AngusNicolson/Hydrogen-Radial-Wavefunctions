# Hydrogen-Radial-Wavefunctions
Python code to calculate and display the radial wavefunction of Hydrogen. This is a two particle system so can be solved exactly.

# Improvements
Implement a function to calculate normalisation term of each wavefunction. i.e. solve analytically rather than numerically. This would mean small sections of a wavefunction could be drawn and normalised correctly.
